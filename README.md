I developed this fullstack social media web app because I wanted to hone my knowledge of the MERN stack along with Next.js. Initially, I decided to go with Next's default server option. Then, I discarded that and went with the custom Express server since that allowed me to use WebSockets (Socket.io in my case) in my app for realtime chats. Besides this, this is a simple social media web app. You can create a post, like it, follow other users, comment on posts, delete your post or comment, and so on and so forth. 

## Technologies used
